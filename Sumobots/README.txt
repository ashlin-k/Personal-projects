Libraries include two classes:

1. Sumobot - a robot that is supposed to stay inside a ring and push other robots out of the ring; uses white line detection on a black surface to identify the line.

2. Wall-follower (WF) - a robot that is supposed to move parallel to a wall

The robotics competition included sumobot and wall-following components.

Maximum area triangulation (MAT) is a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. This version has been adapted for only 3 robots. This algorithm currently only uses angle data (ie. robots can only transmit and detect radial signals from other robots). Odometry data has not yet been used, but can be used to improve accuracy.

Here is a video of triangulation aglorithms and MAT:

This project is a MATLAB/Simulink/Simscape model of a two-link planar arm. The dynamic model is determined experimentally through a dynamic parameter identification (DPI) simulation. The DPI equation is represented in the form

T = Y(q, qd, qdd) * PI

Where T is the joint torques, PI, is the dynamic parameters we wish to solve for, and Y is regressor matrix, which is a function of joint position, velocity and acceleration. Y linearizes the relationship between T and pi. By measuring T, q, qd and qdd, we can solve for PI.

Equations and variables are loaded from a mat file generated by twolinkarm_DPI2.m. twolinkarm_init.m runs loads this mat file and runs the Simscape model. Joint torque, joint position, joint velocity and joint acceleration data is collected from sensors in the model and used to solve for PI. T and Y matrices are vertically concatenated for each data point to generated matrices Ym and Tm

PI = inverse(Ym.' * Ym) * Ym.' * Tm

(Note that Ym.' refers to Ym transpose)
